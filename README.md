## About Data 
Data is in form of directories of classifed shoes images,which is then preprocessed to provide each image with a tag to be ready to get tried in the model

## Libraries/tools used
- TensorFlow 
- MatplotLIb(for image viewing)
- InceptionV3 (neural model trained on ImageNet data)

## About the project
1. This project takes multiples pictures with label as input 
2. Then uses inceptionv3 model is imported to train upon                       -
3. Adding some more layers to the model
4. Fitting the model for given dataset
5. Plotting the loss & accracy
6. Creating the final prediction function
