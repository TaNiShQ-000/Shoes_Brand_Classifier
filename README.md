# Shoes_Brand_Classifier

**Data**- Data is in form of directories of classifed shoes images,which is then preprocessed to provide each image with a tag to be ready to get tried in the model

**Libraries/tools used**- TensorFlow , MatplotLIb(for image viewing) , InceptionV3( neural model trained on ImageNet data)

**About the project**-> This project takes multiples pictures with label as input 
                        -then uses inceptionv3 model to train upon
                        -add some more layers to the model
                        -fitting the model
                        -plotting the loss & accracy
                        -creating the final prediction function
